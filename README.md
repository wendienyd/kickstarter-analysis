# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
A campain project is analyzed for a client to better understand their data. The data was presented more visually by adding conditional formatting, pivot tables, and charts. They were also given an increase analysis of their data by adding statistical components like the measure of spread which includes quartiles, range, standard deviation, and variance.

Recommendation:Since making the box and whisker plot the data that was shown gave an indicator that the mean campaign goal is around 4.000 which is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged. My recommendation is to produce less than 4,000 for the play in your future project.
