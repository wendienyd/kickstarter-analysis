# Overview of Project

The purpose of this Kickstarter project was to inform about how the different types of campaigns were managed in regard to their launch dates and their funding goals. It also serves its purpose by listing details like the goal amount, pledged amount, outcomes, the type of category, the average donation, and a brief description about the campaigns.

## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

A campain project is analyzed for a client to better understand their data. The data was presented more visually by adding conditional formatting, pivot tables, and charts. They were also given an increase analysis of their data by adding statistical components like the measure of spread which includes quartiles, range, standard deviation, and variance.

### Performing analysis and Challenges

How I performed my analysis was by gathering all the data needed to create a chart or a new sheet and insert any necessary formula to calculate my desired result. A challenge I was faced with was with the formula Countifs. I had difficulties in understanding how the formula was formulated since it has multiple steps with its criteria_range and criteria. However, I gave it some time to sink in and it finally registered that what needs to be added manually has to relate to the column selected.

Recommendation:Since making the box and whisker plot the data that was shown gave an indicator that the mean campaign goal is around 4,000 which is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged. My recommendation is to produce less than 4,000 for the play in your future project.

### Results:

- On the pivot table, "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" I could draw up that in the years of 2009 through 2017 the month of May was the most performed in total when it was filtered on the category "theater" so it concludes that May is the month when it generates more traction.
- Theres another conclusion on the table "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" that concludes in the year 2012 the numbers of campaigns compared to the success rate was the highest.
- In reference to the worksheet "Outcomes based on Goals" I concluded that campaigns that had less than $1,000 in funding had a higher successful percentage rate.
- With this project I had the possibility to create another table that would inform anyone what the average donation was made from the variety of countries that was listed.
